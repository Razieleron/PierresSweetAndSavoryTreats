## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open your terminal (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called "HairSalon.Solution/HairSalon".
3. Create a file in /HairSalon called appsettings.json.  In this file, place the following text:

{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=[your database name];uid=[your user ID];pwd=[Your password];"
  }
}


4. In the command line, run the command "dotnet run" to compile and execute the console application. After you have built/run all of your dependencies, you can publish the application to the internet by typing dotnet watch run.  This will open a web browser to LocalHost:5000 or Localhost:5001.  From here you can interact with the application. Since this is a web application, you will interact with it in your web browser.
5. Optionally, you can run "dotnet build" to compile this console app without running it.
